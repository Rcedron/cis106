1.	What resources (websites, tutorials, videos,  magazines, books) are you using to complete the project?
I’ll be using a myriad of resources ranging from the official Ubuntu website, comptia + Linux books, and the youtube channel called Linux Workshop.
2.	What software have you learned or are you currently learning to complete the project?
Learning how to install and run the many open source alternatives to applications through oracle vm. 
3.	What hardware (if applicable) have you learned to use or are currently learning to use to complete the project?
No hardware only just learning how to better utilize virtualization.
4.	Have you encountered any issues? Which ones? How are you planning to solve them?
Providing clear and precise instructions require me to know exactly what does what. My plan is to create a Linux VM and catalogue all the steps I’ve done and condense it down to easy to digest instructions.
