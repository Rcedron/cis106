## Managing files and directories 

* Files and directories can be managed, modified, and re-purposed through commands/options/arguments
* On the terminal, you can type in some of the following commands to tinker with the command line and your file systems
      * ls = list files in present directory 
      * pwd = prints current working directory 
      * mv = move a file or rename a file
      * cat = see the contents within a file
      * mkdir = make a directory 

## Wildcards 
* Wilcards are symbols used to represent characters and take their place.
      *  the "*" will represent all the characters  of a specified name
      *  the "?" represents a single character 
      *  the "[]" are wildcards that can be specified whether to ignore or to focus on whatever parameters are in the brackets
